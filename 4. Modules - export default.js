// As of ES6, JavaScript has implemented a new more readable and flexible syntax for exporting modules.
// These are usually broken down into one of two techniques, default export and named exports.

// Example: 

let Menu = {};

export default Menu;


// 1. export default uses the JavaScript export statement to export JavaScript objects, functions, and primitive data types.
// 2. Menu refers to the name of the Menu object, the object that we are setting the properties on within our modules.

// >>>>> !!!!!!!! When using ES6 syntax, we use export default in place of module.exports. !!!!!!!! <<<<<
